This include searchin an element in the  array .
Basically two methods used are -------------


_______________________________________________________

1) LINEAR SEARCH
____________________
*Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a process that checks every element in the list
  sequentially until the desired element is found.
*The computational complexity for linear search  is O(n).
*The worst case complexity is  O(n), sometimes known an O(n) search, 
  making it generally much less efficient than binary search (O(log n)).
*Time taken to search elements keep increasing as the number of elements are increased.

2) BINARY SEARCH
___________________

*Binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop,
  is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
*Binary search runs in at worst logarithmic time, making O(log n) comparisons, where n is
  the number of elements in the array, the O is Big O notation, and log is the logarithm.

  Important Differences-----------
  __________________________________

 *Input data needs to be sorted in Binary Search and not in Linear Search
 *Linear search does the sequential access whereas Binary search access data randomly.
 *Time complexity of linear search -O(n) , Binary search has time complexity O(log n).
 *Linear search performs equality comparisons and Binary search performs ordering comparisons
